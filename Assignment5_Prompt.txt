This assignment is essentially the same form as lab 4, in that it is an assignment where you are to answer a question using means of your own choosing. The difference is that the question is not determined by your instructor, but is of your own choosing. You may pursue any question within the general topics of operating systems, and your deliverable is a short report explaining how you would (or preferably how you did) answer that question
